    <p> Horster </p>
    <p> Well, if nobody else would</p>

    <p>Petra</p>
    <p>[who has sat down beside her mother]</p>
    <p>And it was a plucky thing to do Captain Horster.</p>

    <p>Horster</p>
    <p>Oh, it is not such a great matter as all that</p>

    <p>[going up to HORSTER]</p>
    <p>Has the Doctor not come yet?</p>

    <p>Horster</p>
    <p>He is waiting in the next room</p>
